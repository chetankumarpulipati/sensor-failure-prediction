## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chethankumarpulipati/sensor-data-analysis.git
    cd sensor-data-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Place the sensor data file `sensor-data.csv` in the project directory.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Final Notebook.ipynb` to execute the analysis.

## Project Structure

- `Final Notebook.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the data analysis and model training.
- `sensor-data.csv`: Sensor data file (not included in the repository).
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `screenshots/pie-chart.png`: Visualization of sensor status distribution.

## Models Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**

## Results

The analysis classifies sensors into normal and broken categories. The final results are visualized using a pie chart.
